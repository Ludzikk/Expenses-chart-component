# Expenses chart component

Website i used to make this: https://www.frontendmentor.io/home

What i used besides css, html:

* gulp
* scss
* bem
* js

My biggest problem was adding cyan column style to column with biggest value. Idea that got it working, was to set highest value from all and then compare id of column which was its value to highest value. If value of id was same as highest value then i added cyan style to that column.
